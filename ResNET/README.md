# 🚀 From VGG to ResNet: A Guided Learning Journey  

When I first learned about VGG, I thought:  

> *“This is so clean! Just keep stacking 3×3 convolutions and we get state-of-the-art performance. Why complicate things?”*  

But then I encountered **ResNet** and realized something surprising: while VGG showed that **depth helps**, going even deeper didn’t always improve performance. Sometimes, more layers made things worse. ResNet’s **residual connections** solved this puzzle.  

This article walks through that thought process — step by step — from VGG, to its problems, to ResNet’s elegant solution.

## 🔹 Step 1: Why VGG was a breakthrough  

Before VGG (2014), architectures like AlexNet used big kernels (11×11, 7×7) and varied structures. VGG simplified everything:  

- Use **only 3×3 convolutions**.  
- Stack them deeply (16 or 19 layers).  
- Add pooling after every few layers.  

📊 **Diagram: VGG16 Block Structure**  

```
Input → [Conv 3×3 → Conv 3×3] → Pool
      → [Conv 3×3 → Conv 3×3] → Pool
      → [Conv 3×3 → Conv 3×3 → Conv 3×3] → Pool
      → Fully Connected → Softmax
```

This design was **clean, uniform, elegant** — and worked really well. VGG-16 achieved **92.7% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet**, becoming the standard backbone for transfer learning.

## 🔹 Step 2: What went wrong when going deeper?  

Naturally, researchers asked:  

> *“If 16–19 layers work, why not 30, 50, or 100 layers?”*  

But when they tried, two problems appeared:  

1. **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**  
   - In very deep networks, backpropagated gradients shrink (vanish) or blow up (explode).  
   - Result: the early layers don’t learn well.  

2. **Degradation Problem**  
   - Strangely, even when gradients didn’t vanish (with careful initialization, batch norm, etc.), deeper networks performed *worse*.  
   - A 56-layer plain CNN got **higher training error** than a 20-layer one.  

👉 This was not overfitting (train error was also worse) — it was an **optimization issue**.

## 🔹 Step 3: ResNet’s breakthrough — Residual Learning  

ResNet (2015) asked a simple but profound question:  

> *“Instead of forcing each block to learn H(x), what if we let it learn the residual F(x) = H(x) – x?”*  

Then the block’s output is:  

**H(x) = F(x) + x**  

📊 **Diagram: ResNet Block**  

```
Input x ───────────────► (+) ──► Output H(x)
        │ Conv → BN → ReLU │
        │ Conv → BN        │
        └──────────────────┘
```

This **skip connection** (shortcut) lets information flow directly through the network.

## 🔹 Step 4: Why residuals help (intuition + math)  

### 🧠 Intuition  

- In VGG: each block must learn the full mapping H(x).  
- In ResNet: each block only needs to learn the *difference* (residual) F(x) = H(x) – x.  

This is like:  

- Writing an essay (VGG): rewrite the whole paragraph from scratch.  
- Editing an essay (ResNet): just add small corrections.  

Easier, right?  

---

### 🔢 Numerical Toy Example  

Suppose the ideal mapping is identity: H(x) = x.  

- **VGG-style block:** Must learn weights that copy input to output. Not trivial.  
- **ResNet block:** Just set F(x) = 0 → then H(x) = x + 0 = x. Perfect!  

This explains why **deeper ResNets never perform worse** — at worst, they can fall back to identity mappings.  

---

### 📐 Mathematical Perspective  

We start with a plain deep network:

$$
H(x) = f_L\big( f_{L-1}(\dots f_1(x) \dots ) \big)
$$

Gradients propagate through a long chain of derivatives:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = \prod_{i=1}^L \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial f_{i-1}}
$$

If any term 
$\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial f_{i-1}} < 1$,  
the product shrinks → **vanishing gradients**.  

If any term 
$\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial f_{i-1}} > 1$,  
the product explodes → **exploding gradients**.  

---

Now consider residual learning:

$$
H(x) = F(x) + x
$$

The gradient becomes:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} 
= \frac{\partial L}{\partial H(x)} \cdot 
\left( \frac{\partial F(x)}{\partial x} + I \right)
$$

The extra **+I** term provides a direct gradient path,  
so gradients can bypass $F(x)$ entirely if needed —  
like a **highway for information flow**

## 🔹 Step 5: Numerical intuition for degradation problem  

Imagine training errors on CIFAR-10:  

- 20-layer plain CNN → train error ~8%.  
- 56-layer plain CNN → train error ~12% (worse!).  
- 56-layer ResNet → train error ~5%.  

Residuals **fix optimization**, not just generalization.  

---

## 🔹 Step 6: PyTorch peek  

Here’s a tiny ResNet block:  

```python
class BasicBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, 3, padding=1)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, 3, padding=1)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)

    def forward(self, x):
        identity = x
        out = F.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))
        out = self.bn2(self.conv2(out))
        out += identity  # skip connection
        return F.relu(out)
```

## 🎯 Final Takeaways  

- **VGG:** Showed that stacking small filters deeply works. Clean and elegant. But going too deep led to optimization failures.  
- **ResNet:** Introduced residual connections. Enabled training of very deep networks (50, 101, 152 layers). Solved vanishing gradients and degradation.  

👉 In short: **VGG proved depth works. ResNet made depth practical.**

## 🔍 When to use VGG vs ResNet?  

- **VGG:**  
  - Good for teaching — very clean, sequential design.  
  - Still used as a feature extractor in transfer learning (though largely replaced by ResNet).  

- **ResNet:**  
  - Standard backbone for most CV tasks.  
  - Much more scalable (50–152 layers).  
  - Stable optimization + strong pretrained weights.

From *“Let’s just stack 3×3 convs”* (VGG) → to *“Let’s skip-connect and go 100+ layers”* (ResNet).
